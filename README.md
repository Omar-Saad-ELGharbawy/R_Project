### Overview  
The United States Census Bureau (USCB), officially the Bureau of the Census, is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and economy. The Census Bureau's primary mission is conducting the U.S. Census every ten years, which allocates the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to the states based on their population. The Bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $675 billion in federal funds every year and it helps states, local communities, and businesses make informed decisions. The information provided by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools, hospitals, transportation infrastructure, and police and fire departments.

## My Report
### Queation 1. Is there a relationship between age and income?  
I have noticed a relation between age and income as ages from 37 to 51 has the highest percentage of having income more than 50k while at ages of small people (17:20) and very old people (82:88) they have percentage of only having income less than 50k.
### Question 2. Can we say that we have achieved gender equality? 
I have concluded that we didnâ€™t achieve gender equality because for people who works 40 hours per week the male percentage of having income more than 50 k is 26.68% while the female percentage is 10.158%.
### Question 3. What other attribute/s could be an income predictor/s?
I deduced that work class, race and education can be also an income predictor as in work class and race percentage of having income more than 50 k changes from one work class and race to another and also the education has high effect on the percent of having high income as high education degrees has more percentage of having high income and number of years of education has high effect on the percent of having high income as by increasing the years of education the percentage increases.
